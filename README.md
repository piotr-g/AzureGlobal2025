## 7. Let's Code!
- Start your Codespace
- create files:
    - app.py
    - Dockerfile
    - main.tf
    - .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## app.py
```Python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Global Azure 2025!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
## Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install flask

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## main.tf
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=4.1.0"
    }
  }
}
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "example-resources" #change here
    storage_account_name = "tfstorage123dominik" #change here
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

  sku_name            = "P0v3"
}


resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "example" {
  name                = "example-webapp-123123i95u8fhwfdsewdwsa" #change here
  location            = "westeurope" #change here
  resource_group_name = "example-resources" #change here
  service_plan_id     = azurerm_service_plan.example.id
  site_config {}
}
